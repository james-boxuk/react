# Imparative Programming vs Declarative Programming

The code above is a good example of imperative programming. You're writing the steps for how the user interface should be updated. But when it comes to building user interfaces, a declarative approach is often preferred because it can speed up the development process. Instead of having to write DOM methods, it would be helpful if developers were able to declare what they want to show (in this case, an h1 tag with some text).

In other words, imperative programming is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza, as shown in the small example we did in the index.html file where we wrote instructions to create the h1 tag and append the tag to the DOM.


. Declarative programming is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza, where we are using reacts internal functions to append html to the DOM. So we dont need to know the ins and outs of how react does this.

React is a popular declarative library that you can use build user interfaces.
